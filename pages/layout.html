    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I did this project while in school. The main reasin that I like to use it is to show divere thinking when it comes to grids. Much of the course that this was a part of was about staying to a simple grid and not swaying very far. This project allowed us to show our creativity and was one of my favorites.</p>
