Utilizing the tools provided by Wix, which are very limiting, we were able to create a clean, modern and fun design for the game store. We also created custom database entries in Wix to update new card game releases automatically, using jQuery, along with adding custom widgets for Discord and TCGPlayer. As for social media, we created a clean aesthetic that gets straight to the point and delivers the information needed to the user. We are also creating a Twitter and YouTube account for the store, so that we can post box openings of product and reviews to furhter engage customers.",

They needed to have forms from Bloomerang properly formatted and setup through their Wix site, which doesn't offer direct support to Bloomerang. They approached multiple shops regarding this and were given options that did not fit their needs. We were able to customize the forms HTML, CSS, and Javascript directly so that the forms could be from Bloomerang and formatted to their liking. We also corrected errors in regard to the form captchas not working properly by updating the site keys via Google's captcha API.",

First off, Michael was very professional and came to us with great ideas to help our internet business grow and look more professional. The prices were very fair and generous for the work he put forth. His work alone increased our Web Presence by 38% and our sales increased by 27% for web orders. I would highly recommend him to any and all companies that want to increase web orders and web presence.\""

Other vendors would only take on the project if we would settle for a workaround solution, but Michael made it happen. He was able to get the forms up and running while also making them look visually appealing. He listened to our needs and produced great results despite the weird quirks we found with the Wix platform.",
			"testimonialPThree": " He also helped us to optimize our site and fix some other pieces that were giving our staff some trouble. He was very responsive and a great communicator through the whole process. He went above and beyond on our project.\""
