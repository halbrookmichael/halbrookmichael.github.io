First off Michael was very professional and came to us with great ideas to help our internet business grow and look more professional.  The prices were very fair and generous for the work he put forth.  His work alone increased our Web Presence by 38% and our sales increased by 27% for web orders.  I would highly recommend him any and all companies that want to increase web orders and web presence.\""

			"testimonialPTwo": "It was important to us that we use the code provided by our database provider for the forms on our site. Other vendors would only take on the project if we would settle for a workaround solution, but Michael made it happen. He was able to get the forms up and running while also making them look visually appealing. He listened to our needs and produced great results despite the weird quirks we found with the Wix platform.",
			"testimonialPThree": " He also helped us to optimize our site and fix some other pieces that were giving our staff some trouble. He was very responsive and a great communicator through the whole process. He went above and beyond on our project.\""
